This mod is still in very early development. The primary focus is on flying a ship in IVA and moving around in EVA. As such no other scenes are supported: map mode, VAB, any kind of UI interaction, etc. Keeping that in mind, you are welcome to try it out and report any issues or feedback.

Note: this is a fork of Kerbal-VR originally created by @Vivero. This version uses Unity's native VR systems to render, which means it generally performs better but doesn't support special effects or UI out of the box. I've also added an extensive interaction system for manipulating switches, buttons, knobs, etc. in IVA.
